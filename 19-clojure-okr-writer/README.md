# clojure-okr-writer

Clojure CLI template that drafts OKRs from goals.

This repo is intentionally written in **Clojure** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
clj -M main.clj
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
